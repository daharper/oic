The coding conventions of the .Dfm file are as follows:

* for simple types (Integer, Boolean, String, ), the value is simply saved after "="

	Left = 192

* for sets, the values are stored between "[" and "]"

	 Options = [dgTitles, dgIndicator, dgColumnResize]

* for tStrings and tList, the values are between "(" and ")":

	Items.Strings = (
      'Felix COLIBRI Delphi Training Sessions:'
      '    +  UML and Design Patterns'
      '    +  Interbase Applications'
      '    +  Object Oriented Programming'
      '    +  Client Server Database')

* for binary values (bitmaps for glyphs etc), the hexadecimal content is saved between "{" and "}"

	Picture.Data = {
      07544269746D617036550000424D365500000000000036000000280000005500
      000055000000010018000000000000550000C40E0000C40E0000000000000000
      ... 
      FF16}

* for collections, the delimiters are "<" and ">", with each item in between. And for each item,
	between the item name and "end", we have the property name and value:

	Columns = <
      item
        Expanded = False
        Visible = True
      end
      item
        Expanded = False
        Visible = True
      end>

* for sub properties (like Font), the property name is composed with the property name and the sub-property name:

	object Form1: TForm1
	  ...
	  Font.Charset = DEFAULT_CHARSET
	  Font.Color = clWindowText
	  Font.Height = -11
	  Font.Name = 'MS Sans Serif'
	  Font.Style = []
	  ...
	end

* components dropped on a container are nested within the container definition:

	object Form1: TForm1
	  ...
	  object Panel1: TPanel
		...
		object CheckBox1: TCheckBox
		  Left = 8
		  ...
		end
	  end
	  ...
	end
